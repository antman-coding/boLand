                        You're watching a video, reading an article, or consuming other media online that interests you. You can't wait
                        to discuss the content in a serious manner. You scroll down to finally engage in the discussion, and the first
                        thing you see is <i>2 views in 90 seconds bro fell off.</i> Unfortunately, no amount of scrolling seems to get
                        to a single comment that isn't trying to be humorous.
