                        You're watching a video, reading an article, or consuming other media online that interests you. You can't wait
                        to discuss the content in a serious manner. You scroll down to finally engage in the discussion, and the first
                        thing you see is <i>2 views in 90 seconds bro fell off.</i> Unfortunately, no amount of scrolling seems to get
                        to a single comment that isn't trying to be humorous. This is one of the worst turns the internet has every made

                            The only thing that can fix the internet is you. When your watching Youtube, browsing a form or doing any
                            other activity where you can contribute to the discuss, do so. Little by little we can make the internet
                            not somewhere we have to be, but somewhere we want to.
