        "The first time I listened to JPEGMAFIA's \"LP!\", I didn't know how to feel about it. I did know I had never heard something like it. The production was crazy, his voice was mindblowing, and the lyricism was great. It switches ideas so fast, yet still comes together without dissapointment.",

    {"rating":6, "album":"Diamond Jubilee", "artist":"Cindy Lee", "content":
        "When this record first came out, I had seen it being disscussed, but had not listened to it (mostly due too its daunting 2 hour runtime), and I have never regretted ignoring something more. Nothing in the 32 long tracklist \"misses\" for me. The switching between singing styles works well throughout the double album, and is emotional complex.",

    {"rating":6, "album":"IGOR", "artist":"Tyler, the Creator", "content":
        "The breakup neo soul album by one of the most respected, previously polarizing, artists today. And to top it all off, it was about a queer reationship, told by someone previously viewed as homophobic. It also features his best songs musiclly and delivers emotion in a astounding way.",
